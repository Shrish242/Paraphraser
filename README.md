Paraphraser

This project involves fine-tuning the Pegasus model, a state-of-the-art transformer-based language model, for paraphrasing tasks. The training process was conducted using a custom dataset consisting of pairs of original and paraphrased sentences. After training, the fine-tuned model was saved, allowing for efficient generation of paraphrased text from new input sentences. The final model is optimized for text generation tasks where rephrasing content while maintaining its original meaning is required.
